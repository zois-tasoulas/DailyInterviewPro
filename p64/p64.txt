You are given a binary tree representation of an arithmetic
expression. In this tree, each leaf is an integer value, and
a non-leaf node is one of the four operations: '+', '-',
'*', or '/'.

Write a function that takes this tree and evaluates the
expression.

Example:

    *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5


This is a representation of the expression
(3 + 2) * (4 + 5), and should return 45.
