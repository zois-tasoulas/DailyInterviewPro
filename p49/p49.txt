Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue,
sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are
adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the
color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not supposed to use the library sort function
for this problem.

Can you do this in a single pass?

Example:

Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
