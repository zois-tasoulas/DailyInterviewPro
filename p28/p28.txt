You are given a hash table where the key is a course code,
and the value is a list of all the course codes that are
prerequisites for the key. Return a valid ordering in which
we can complete the courses. If no such ordering exists,
return NULL.

Example:
{
  'CSC300': ['CSC100', 'CSC200'], 
  'CSC200': ['CSC100'], 
  'CSC100': []
}


This input should return the order that we need to take these courses:
 ['CSC100', 'CSC200', 'CSCS300']
