You are given the root of a binary tree. You need to
implement 2 functions:

1. serialize(root) which serializes the tree into a string
representation
2. deserialize(s) which deserializes the string back to the
original tree that it represents

For this problem, often you will be asked to design your
own serialization format. However, for simplicity, let's
use the pre-order traversal of the tree.
