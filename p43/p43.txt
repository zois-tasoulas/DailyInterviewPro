You are given an array of integers. Return the smallest
positive integer that is not present in the array. The
array may contain duplicate entries.

For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should return 2
because it is the smallest positive integer that doesn't
exist in the array.

Your solution should run in linear time and use constant
space.
