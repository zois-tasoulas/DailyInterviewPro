You are given a 2D array of characters, and a target string.
Return whether or not the target word exists in the matrix.
Unlike a standard word search, the word must be either going
left-to-right, or top-to-bottom in the matrix.

Example:

[['F', 'A', 'C', 'I'],
 ['O', 'B', 'Q', 'P'],
 ['A', 'N', 'O', 'B'],
 ['M', 'A', 'S', 'S']]

Given this matrix, and the target word FOAM, you should
return true, as it can be found going up-to-down in the
first column.
