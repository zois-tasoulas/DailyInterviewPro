A unival tree is a tree where all the nodes have the same
value. Given a binary tree, return the number of unival
subtrees in the tree.

For example, the following tree should return 5:

   0
  / \
 1   0
    / \
   1   0
  / \
 1   1


The 5 trees are:
- The three single '1' leaf nodes. (+3)
- The single '0' leaf node. (+1)
- The [1, 1, 1] tree at the bottom. (+1)
