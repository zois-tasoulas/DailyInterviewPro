Given a linked list of integers, remove all consecutive
nodes that sum up to 0.

Example:
Input: 10 -> 5 -> -3 -> -3 -> 1 -> 4 -> -4
Output: 10

The consecutive nodes 5 -> -3 -> -3 -> 1 sums up to 0 so
that sequence should be removed. 4 -> -4 also sums up to 0
too so that sequence should also be removed.
