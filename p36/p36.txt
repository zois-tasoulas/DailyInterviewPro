You are given an array of integers. Find the maximum sum of
all possible contiguous subarrays of the array.

Example:
[34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86]

Given this input array, the output should be 137. The
contiguous subarray with the largest sum is
[42, 14, -5, 86].

Your solution should run in linear time.
